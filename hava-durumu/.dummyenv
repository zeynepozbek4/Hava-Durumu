To use the website on your own, you should go through the following steps:
1-Rename this file as .env
2-Copy your own API keys that you provide from OpenWeatherAPI to VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY and from Weatherbit API to VITE_WEATHER2_API_KEY in the bottommost lines
3-Delete all instruction lines between #### signs

CAUTION: you need a business trial in Weatherbit to access the data, which is only up for 21 days unless you pay for full access, but that is unnecessary for short-term usage of my website.
